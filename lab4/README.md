## Ethics Questions

### Question 1

> What information do you think the company should be able to access, if any?

<!-- Put your answer to question 1 here -->
I think it's probably fine to access all the user-inputted information so long as the user is made aware
up front that anything they input will be saved and the reasons for saving the data. It is important to keep in mind that personal contact infomration and payment information be kept completely secure.

### Question 2

> What information do you think should be off limits, if any?
Any information bought from a third party. You should only have access to what the user has provided you. It is important that payment information, contact inforamtion, social security number, etc is kept in a secure place and not accessed outside of the appropriate areas where thiss information is securely stored. Health information can also be another tricky subject. If a customer is entering sensitive health information, this should also be taken to the highest security standard and may not be able to be used or tracked depending on the data entered. There are some that have privacy concerns that they might be "watched" while on certain web applications, but as long as it is not secure information this is often used to improve applications or as marketing strategies for targeting people with certain interests to promote their application or product. An example I think about is when using some softwares or applications on the computer or phone. A message will pop up asking if the person would like to report back errors or feedback to improve the application and the user is able to choose yes or no.


### Question 3

> How would you handle user sensitive data that your boss thinks is useful to the company in its metrics?
	Either try to find a way to not have that information associated with specific customers, or remove
	that data after it's been used. There are ways to deidentify data or information, and this could become useful if certain data is needed to improve the application.
